These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Cisco CLI Command Expert application (the "App"). The App may also be referred to in some materials as "Cisco IOS Gemini AI Expert" or "Cisco IOS AI" (collectively, the "App"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2. Description of the Service
The App is an AI-assisted tool that helps users explore Cisco IOS, IOS XE, and IOS XR command syntax, usage, and troubleshooting.
